RoulleteMizer.

Hello everyone that looks into using this program (I legit don't know why would you do that).

in an attempt to learn how to code I made this program which searchings through a selected directory for any .exe , .lnk or .url  for the time being and starts one of them randomly.

It has many uses such as :
1) Deciding what game you will play if you can't decide for yourself
2) //TODO


 I dont expect people to use it, I just made this in the rare occurance actually someone may use it unironically.
 its extremely bad, it can't handle anything out of the ordinary and you can break it extremely easily. 
I may update it in the future thinking of maybe adding a imagemizer mode where it cycles through photos instead and picks how many the user requests out of a folder. but thats in the future

Anyway thanks for reading thus far. You can find instructions as how exactly it works (it's rocket science so pay attention it has 2 buttons).
Love you Voskos.
